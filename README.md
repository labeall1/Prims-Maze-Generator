# Prims-Maze-Generator

About this code:
- This code creates a random maze using Prim's Algorithm
- The maze is different everytime the code is run
- The maze was created by using a Cell class to represent the different cells of the maze
- The cells represent the "vertices" and the walls represent the "edges" in Prim's Algorithm
- Walls are "busted" down to create a pathway/maze
- The maze represents the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) created

Classes:
- Cell.java: This file represents the Cell object and its attributes
- Maze.java: This file is how the maze is generated and where the algorithm is coded
- MazeVisual.java: This file is where the basic visual of the maze is created before the algorithm is run

How to run this code:
- Run this code in an IDE (I use IntelliJ)
- Run the main method in MazeVisual.java
- A maze will be generated
